Introduction
------------

libGPML is a programming library that helps you read, write, validate, manipulate, and convert files and data streams in the [GPML (Graphical Pathway Markup Language)](https://pathvisio.github.io/documentation/GPML) format.  

Why not simply use a generic XML parsing library?  A specialized library such as libGPML offers many advantages over using a generic XML library directly.  Here are some:

* **Java object model**.  libGPML's object model and API are designed around GPML and the operations that are commonly needed when working with GPML.

* **Validation**. libGPML implements all the validation rules defined in the GPML specifications.

* **Conversion**: libGPML can convert between GPML2013a and GPML2021. Conversions between GPML2013a and older 

libGPML works on Linux, Windows, and  MacOS X, and other operating systems. 

Library Architecture
------------

libGPML consists of mainly the ....Documentation in progres...and java object model classes.
