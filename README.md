Introduction
------------

LibPathVisio is a programming library that helps you read, write, validate, manipulate, and convert files and data streams in the [GPML (Graphical Pathway Markup Language)](http://sbml.org) format.  

Why not simply use a generic XML parsing library?  A specialized library such as libSBML or [JSBML](https://github.com/sbmlteam/jsbml) offers many advantages over using a generic XML library directly.  Here are some:

* **Domain-specific object model**.  libPathVisio's object model and API are designed around GPML and the operations that are commonly needed when working with GPML.

* **Validation facilities**. libPathVisio implements all the validation rules defined in the GPML specifications.

* **Conversion facilities**: libPathVisio can convert between GPML2013a and GPML2021. 

LibPathVisio works on Linux, Windows, and  MacOS X, and other operating systems.
